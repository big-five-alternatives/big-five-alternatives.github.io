## Home of privacy-centric alternatives to the big five

The goal of this repository, is to have a reasonable alternatives for products provided by the big five tech companies.
The repository will include a list of products ( Gmail, Google Maps, AWS, etc.) each of which will have a list of alternatives with instructions on how to setup if necessary.

If you have any suggestions or modifications, please make a github issue here.

And yes, I realize the irony that this is hosted on Github (ie: Microsoft), but this is not about where BFA is hosted, is it?
